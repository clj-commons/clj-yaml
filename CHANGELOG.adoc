WARNING: We addressed the breaking change in 0.7.169.

== v0.7.169 - 2022-09-26 [minor breaking]

WARNING: We have discovered that some folks use some clj-yaml functionality we assumed was internal.
This release changed the `YAMLCodec` `decode` function signature and will be a breaking change for those people who directly use this lower level function.
Other users should be unaffected.
